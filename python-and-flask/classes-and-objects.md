'object' means something completely different in Python and in JavaScript. In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs. In Python, they would call this a __dictionary__. In Python, the word object essentially just means 'thing'. The closest that JavaScript has to Python objects is __values__. In Python, you would say that the value 5 is an object.

'class' is also used differently in the two languages. JavaScript has classes, but they're hacky - you can forget about them. The closest thing that JavaScript has to Python classes is _prototypes_. A Python class is like a template for an object: it is from classes that you create objects. When you create an object from a class, you _initialize_ the class. 

You iniialize a class by calling it like a function. If you provide arguments to the class name when you initialize it, these are passed to the class's ```__init__()``` method.
